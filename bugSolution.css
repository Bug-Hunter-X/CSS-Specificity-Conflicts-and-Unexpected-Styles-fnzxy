The solution is to carefully examine your CSS specificity rules and restructure your selectors to achieve the desired outcome.  In the example above, if you need the element to be blue or red under specific circumstances, you may need to adjust the class structure, or add more specific rules:

**Option 1: Using more specific selectors (if you want green to be the overriding color):**

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myClass {
  color: green;
}
```

**Option 2: Using the `!important` flag (generally discouraged):**

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue !important;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myClass {
  color: green;
}
```

This example is a simple illustration.  More complex scenarios might involve multiple classes, inheritance, and nested selectors, making debugging more involved. Using a browser's developer tools to inspect the computed styles can be invaluable.
