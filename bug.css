The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue: unexpected behavior due to specificity conflicts:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myClass {
  color: green; /* This rule is more specific and overrides the previous ones */
}
```

In this scenario, an element with both the `id` `myElement` and the class `myClass` will have a green color.  However, unexpected results can arise when dealing with nested selectors, inheritance, and complex class structures.  Debugging these often requires a careful examination of CSS specificity rules.
